# DiabetesPrediction
Diabetes Prediction model in Google Colab using Support Vector Machine (SVM).
1)Overview:
-This project implements a Diabetes Prediction System using Machine Learning (Support Vector Machine) in Python.
-The model predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on medical parameters such as glucose level, BMI, age, etc.
Note:-The project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset and is built in Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook.
Features

2)Data preprocessing and cleaning
-Feature scaling using StandardScaler.
-Model training using SVM.
-Accuracy evaluation on training and test data.
-Real-time prediction for new patient input.

3)Machine Learning Workflow
-Load Dataset
-Handle missing values (replace zeros with mean)
-Separate Features (X) and Target (Y)
-Split data into Training & Testing sets
-Standardize features
-Train SVM classifier
-Evaluate model accuracy
-Predict diabetes for new input data

4)Technologies Used:Python,NumPy,Pandas,Scikit-learn,Google Colab
